# Pomodoro Timer
This project is a web-based timer that uses the Pomodoro technique to boost productivity and focus. The Pomodoro method divides work periods (commonly 25 minutes) into defined sessions: a focused work interval, a short rest period, and, after several cycles, a longer break to refresh your mind. This implementation is designed to help you manage time effectively, reduce burnout, and track your progress through each cycle.

# Features
- Customizable Intervals: Allow users to adjust the duration of the focus period, as well as short breaks and long breaks.
- To-do List: Give the users a way to keep track of tasks.
- YouTube Music Player: Embed a YouTube music player for background music while working.
- Local Data Persistence: Utilize local storage to save user time preferences and tasks.
