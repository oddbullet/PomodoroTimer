# Pomodoro Timer
This project is a web-based timer that uses the Pomodoro technique to boost productivity and focus. The Pomodoro method divides work periods (commonly 25 minutes) into defined sessions a focused work interval, a short rest period, and, after several cycles, a longer break. This implementation is designed to help you manage time effectively, reduce burnout, and track your progress through each cycle.
